# Ansible-Pull

This Ansible playbook is a modified version of a previous playbook I made to install Jenkins (see https://github.com/Omar-Khawaja/ansible_jenkins_centos7 for the original playbook).
You can use Ansible-pull with this repo. For more information on Ansible-pull, http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html#ansible-pull
